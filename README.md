# DesignPatternsUpgrade

## 📌 Overview

**DesignPatternsUpgrade** is a project focused on implementing various software design patterns in C#. It serves as a reference for developers looking to understand and apply these patterns in real-world applications.

## 📂 Implemented Design Patterns

### Structural Patterns
- 🔌 **Adapter** – Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
- 🌉 **Bridge** – Decouples abstraction from implementation.
- 🌳 **Composite** – Represents a hierarchy of objects.
- 🎭 **Decorator** – Dynamically adds behavior to objects.

### Behavioral Patterns
- 🔗 **Chain of Responsibility** – Passes requests along a chain of handlers.
- 🕹 **Command** – Encapsulates a request as an object.
- 🗣 **Mediator** – Manages interactions between objects.
- 👀 **Observer** – Defines a dependency between objects for event handling.
- 🎭 **Strategy** – Encapsulates interchangeable algorithms.
- 📝 **Template Method** – Defines a skeleton for an algorithm.
